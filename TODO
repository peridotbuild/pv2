Implement most os.path related operations to pathlib

Rationale: os.path is quite clunky. A precursory look at pathlib tells me:

* Using pathlib makes it clearer what a path is vs a string
* It is a more modern way to handle file system paths
* Since python 3.6, pathlib paths can be passed into shutil and os.path
* Can be used cross-platform (not that this will be used on windows)

Only downside is it may not handle s3 URL's very well, but that may or may not
be a problem in the future when the support is added.

Add s3 upload options to general importer

Rationale: It should be possible to pre-emptively upload an artifact into an s3
bucket before the actual srpmproc stage. The srpmproc stage will generally check
whatever bucket it is assigned to to see if it's there before import (unless the
options to not upload is given in whatever manner). Two birds, one stone with
the imports, essentially.
