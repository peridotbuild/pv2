Implement most os.path related operations to pathlib

Rationale: os.path is quite clunky. A precursory look at pathlib tells me:

* Using pathlib makes it clearer what a path is vs a string
* It is a more modern way to handle file system paths
* Since python 3.6, pathlib paths can be passed into shutil and os.path
* Can be used cross-platform (not that this will be used on windows)

Only downside is it may not handle s3 URL's very well, but that may or may not
be a problem in the future when the support is added.

The importer and srpmproc modules do a lot of "raises", they should be using try
and excepts where possible to make things more consistent.

Most of this should be addressed already.

# April 25, 2025
The srpmproc editor needs to support an "AddLines" function, though this should
be achieved with SNR just fine. Maybe I'll add this, maybe I won't.

# April 26, 2025
The srpmproc importer needs to support modularity YAML's. This shouldn't be
difficult to do.

A testing framework needs to be setup to test certain functions of PV2 as a
whole.

Perhaps employ **kwargs in the import classes
